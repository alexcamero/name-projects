The app was made with JavaScript (jQuery) and PHP. Earlier versions used MySQL and Python (Flask). The data is put out by the SSA from [their data]( https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/index.html) on applications for social security numbers. In this repo there is also some related python scripts that I was (and probably still will) use to play with the data.
